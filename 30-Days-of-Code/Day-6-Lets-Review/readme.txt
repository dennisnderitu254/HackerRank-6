Completed all languages available 2017-1-17 except Brainfuck, LOLCODE, and Smalltalk

LOLCODE 1.2 for lci 0.10.5 does not have string indexing, splits, etc.
Smalltalk passes test and smaller cases, but Abort is called for larger test cases. Need either more efficient algorithm and/or more info about environment.
